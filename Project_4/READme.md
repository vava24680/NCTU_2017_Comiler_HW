## Compiler Project 4 Introduction
* all the test files are in the TestCase folder
* Array declaration, accessing and all the part related to array are not implementd
* String as parameter passing is not implementd neither
* Already with jasmin.jar file
* To run the code, use these instrunctions below as order
```shell=
$ make clean compile
$ ./a.out TestCase/"test_files".p
$ java -jar jasmin.jar TestCase/"test_files".j
$ java "test_files"
# test_files is the name of the test file, change it any test file that you want to test
```
## File meaning
* `a.out` Compiler Executable File
* `scanner.l` is responsible for tokenize the input
* `parser.y` is responsible for check if the input is valid or not
* `node.h` is the declaration of node structure of each node in AST(Abstract Syntax Tree) and some useful function
* `node.cpp` is the implementation of `node.h`
* `symbol_table.h` is the declaration of symbol table structure and useful function which are responsible for managing symbol table
* `symbol_table.cpp` is the implementation of `symbol_table.h`
* `CodeGen.h` is the declaration of function related to code generation
* `CodeGen.cpp` is the implementation of `CodeGen.h`
* `CodeGen.cpp` and `symbol_table.cpp` is similar and they also traverse the Abstract Syntax Tree created in parser
* `Makefile` has two main targets which are `clean` and `compile`, `clean` is used to remove the files generated by flex and bison, `compile` is used to compile every file to a executable file
